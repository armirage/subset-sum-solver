 *
 * @desc In computer science, the subset sum problem (SSP) is an important decision
 * problem in complexity theory and cryptography. There are several equivalent
 * formulations of the problem.
 *
 * One example; Knapsack problem. Given a knapsack of size 's' and items of
 * varying sizes 'w', what combinations of items will pack the knapsack with the
 * most stuff.
 *
 * The 'problem' is while it is relatively easy to check if a subset is correct,
 * it is exponentially harder to find the subset as a solution. This makes the
 * SSP NP-Complete. A group of Math problems whose renown difficulty have been
 * both the bane and advantage to things like cryptography, packing problems,
 * navigation, etc.
 *
 * There are techniques with different advantages and disadvantages.
 * This technique uses a Branch-and-Bound with early pruning as an heuristic
 * sieve to solve the problem quickly. Quicker than any comparative technique.
 *
 * (Some techniques are quicker with small input sizes.)
 *
 * PRECONDITIONS:
 * 	* Given an array of numbers.
 * 	* Given a target number.
 * 	* Numbers may be positive, negative, decimal, or zero.
 *
 * POSTCONDITIONS:
 *  * Returns an Array of strings. Each string is the number and its index.
 *  * (This is to retain multiplicity of the numbers. In concert with the
 *    original array the index can be used to discern the exact input returned.)
 *
 * SIDE EFFECTS:
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 *
 * @see {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem | Subset sum problem}
